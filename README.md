# Node.js CRUD Application with Prisma and MongoDB

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Node.js, Prisma, and MongoDB. It demonstrates the basic functionalities of a web application, allowing users to interact with a database through a simple and intuitive interface. The use of Prisma as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool simplifies database operations, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project locally. By following these steps, you'll have a running version of the application on your machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v12.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)
- MongoDB (Follow the MongoDB installation guide for your OS)

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ardhrubo/prisma-mongo.git
 ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd node-prisma-mongodb-crud
 ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Generate Prisma client:**

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

5. **Run the Prisma migrations (optional):**

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

6. **Start the application:**

```bash
npm start
```

### The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
